## ITMD 362, Production Problem 04: Implementing HCI guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either iOS or Android, sketch a new small-screen touch-friendly design
for the membership/join page for Chicagoâ€™s Museum of Contemporary Art at
https://experience.mcachicago.org/donate/contribute1?ct=6 (Hint: visit the URL on your phone).

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/
* Android Guidelines:
  https://developer.android.com/design

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1. photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2. an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guideline One (URL):https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/controls/buttons/ 
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:
I implemented it in the way that now there is a border from some buttons to make the user be aware that it is clickable, as stated on the guidleines ". In some content areas, however, a border or background is necessary to denote interactivity." it is not usually necessary but I believe that since the site is just black and white butting a big box with white letters it needs for there to be a separation between the buttons and the rest of the text. Also certain buttons are placed in the site and should be on a specific tab only or centered/floated to the left.
* HCI Guideline Two (URL):https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/color/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: I implemented the color guideline in the way that in in the mcachicago site when the user clicks a button it turns a very ugly bright yellow and the site being white and black it does not go with the color palette and it should be changed maybe a grey color thats faded or even the same black lightly faded for the user to see they are clicking something but not get an ugly button. 

* HCI Guideline Three (URL):https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/terminology/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: There needs to be less text when checking out to and have direct text that makes the checking out quickly and easily, the text with provided information about tickets should be on another site.
